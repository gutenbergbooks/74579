    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The first day was an ecstasy,</div>
      <div class='line'>A golden mist, a burgeoning tree;</div>
      <div class='line'>We rode like gods through a world new-made,</div>
      <div class='line'>The hawthorn scented hill and glade,</div>
      <div class='line'>A faint, still sweetness in the air—</div>
      <div class='line'>And, oh, her face and the wind in her hair!</div>
      <div class='line'>And the steady beat of our good steeds’ hooves,</div>
      <div class='line'>Bearing us northward, strong and fast,</div>
      <div class='line'>To my high black tower, stark to the blast,</div>
      <div class='line'>Like a swimmer stripped where the Solway moves!</div>
      <div class='line'>And ever, riding, we chanted a song,</div>
      <div class='line'>Challenging Fortune, loud and long,</div>
      <div class='line'>“<i>From Belton Castle to Solway side,</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>Strive as you may, is three days’ ride!</i>”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>She slept for an hour, wrapped in my cloak,</div>
      <div class='line'>And I watched her till the morning broke;</div>
      <div class='line'>The second day—and a harsher land,</div>
      <div class='line'>And gray bare hills on either hand;</div>
      <div class='line'>A surly land and a sullen folk,</div>
      <div class='line'>And a fog that came like bitter smoke.</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>The road wound on like a twisted snake,</div>
      <div class='line'>And our horses sobbed as they topped the brake.</div>
      <div class='line'>Till we sprang to earth at Wyvern Fen,</div>
      <div class='line'>Where fresh steeds stamped, and were off again.</div>
      <div class='line'>Weary and sleepless, bruised and worn,</div>
      <div class='line'>We still had strength for laughter and scorn;</div>
      <div class='line'>Love held us up through the mire and mist,</div>
      <div class='line'>Love fed us, while we clasped and kissed,</div>
      <div class='line'>And still we sang as the night closed in,</div>
      <div class='line'>Stealthy and slow as a hidden sin,</div>
      <div class='line'>“<i>From Belton Castle to Solway side,</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>Ride how you will, is three days’ ride.</i>”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>My love drooped low on the black mare’s back,</div>
      <div class='line'>Drowned in her hair ... the reins went slack ...</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet she could not sleep, save to dream bad dreams,</div>
      <div class='line'>And wake all trembling, till at last</div>
      <div class='line'>Her golden head lay on my breast.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>At last we saw the first faint gleams</div>
      <div class='line'>Of day. Dawn broke. A sickly light</div>
      <div class='line'>Came from the withered sun—a blight</div>
      <div class='line'>Was on the land, and poisonous mist</div>
      <div class='line'>Shrouded the rotting trees, unkissed</div>
      <div class='line'>By any wind, and black crags glared</div>
      <div class='line'>Like sightless, awful faces, spared</div>
      <div class='line'>From death to live accursed for ay.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Dragging slow chains the hours went by.</div>
      <div class='line'>We rode on, drunk and drugged with sleep,</div>
      <div class='line'>Too deadly weary now to say</div>
      <div class='line'>Whether our horses kept the way</div>
      <div class='line'>Or no—like slaves stretched on a heap</div>
      <div class='line'>Of poisoned arrows. Every limb</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>Shot with sharp pain; pain seemed to swim</div>
      <div class='line'>Like a red cloud before our eyes....</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The mist broke, and a moment showed,</div>
      <div class='line'>Pricked clear against a splash of woad,</div>
      <div class='line'>The spear-points where the hot chase rode.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Idly I watched them dance and rise</div>
      <div class='line'>Till white wreaths wiped them out again ...</div>
      <div class='line'>My love jerked at the bridle rein;</div>
      <div class='line'>The black mare, dying, broke her heart</div>
      <div class='line'>In one swift gallop; for my part</div>
      <div class='line'>I dozed; and ever in my brain,</div>
      <div class='line'>Four hoofs of fire beat out refrain,</div>
      <div class='line'>A dirge to light us down to death,</div>
      <div class='line'>A silly rhyme that saith and saith,</div>
      <div class='line'>“<i>From Belton Castle to Solway side,</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>Though great hearts break, is three days’ ride!</i>”</div>
      <div class='line'>The black mare staggered, reeled and fell,</div>
      <div class='line'>Bearing my love down ... a great bell</div>
      <div class='line'>Began to toll ... and sudden fire</div>
      <div class='line'>Flared at me from the road, a pyre</div>
      <div class='line'>It seemed, to burn our bodies in ...</div>
      <div class='line'>And I fell down, far down, within</div>
      <div class='line'>The pit’s mouth ... and my brain went blind....</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>I woke—a cold sun rose behind</div>
      <div class='line'>Black evil hills—my love knelt near</div>
      <div class='line'>Beside a stream, her golden hair</div>
      <div class='line'>Streaming across the grass—below</div>
      <div class='line'>The Solway eddied to and fro,</div>
      <div class='line'>White with fierce whirlpools ... my love turned....</div>
      <div class='line'>Thank God, some hours of joy are burned</div>
      <div class='line'>Into the mind, and will remain,</div>
      <div class='line'>Fierce-blazing still, in spite of pain!</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>They came behind us as we kissed,</div>
      <div class='line'>Stealthily from the dripping mist,</div>
      <div class='line'>Her brothers and their evil band.</div>
      <div class='line'>They bound me fast and made me stand.</div>
      <div class='line'>They forced her down upon her knees.</div>
      <div class='line'>She did not strive or cry or call,</div>
      <div class='line'>But knelt there dumb before them all—</div>
      <div class='line'>I could not turn away my eyes—</div>
      <div class='line'>There was no fear upon her face,</div>
      <div class='line'>Although they slew her in that place.</div>
      <div class='line'>The daggers rent and tore her breast</div>
      <div class='line'>Like dogs that snarl above a kill,</div>
      <div class='line'>Her proud face gazed above them still,</div>
      <div class='line'>Seeking rest—Oh, seeking rest!</div>
      <div class='line'>The blood swept like a crimson dress</div>
      <div class='line'>Over her bosom’s nakedness,</div>
      <div class='line'>A curtain for her weary eyes,</div>
      <div class='line'>A muffling-cloth to stop her sighs ...</div>
      <div class='line'>And she was gone—and a red thing lay</div>
      <div class='line'>Silent, on the trampled clay.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Beneath my horse my feet are bound,</div>
      <div class='line'>My hands are bound behind my back,</div>
      <div class='line'>I feel the sinews start and crack—</div>
      <div class='line'>And ever to the hoof-beats’ sound,</div>
      <div class='line'>As we draw near the gallows-tree,</div>
      <div class='line'>Where I shall hang right speedily,</div>
      <div class='line'>A crazy tune rings in my brain,</div>
      <div class='line'>Four hoofs of fire tramp the refrain,</div>
      <div class='line'>Crashing clear o’er the roaring crowd,</div>

      <div class='line'>In which we will not meet, as you surmise;</div>
      <div class='line'>And, after that dull masque has changed its guise,</div>
      <div class='line'>Suppose we make the sun our rendezvous?</div>

      <div class='line'>Naked and white and beautiful you stand,</div>

      <div class='line'>That gaze of clear perfection to my own,</div>
      <div class='line'>And meet the petal-kiss that seems to burn,</div>
      <div class='line'>And makes us less divisible than stone!</div>
